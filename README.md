# Arrow Keys Remapping with AutoHotkey v2.0

This repository contains an AutoHotkey script to remap certain keys to arrow keys and other navigation keys for improved productivity.

## Requirements

- [AutoHotkey v2.0](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

## Installation

1. Download and install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
2. Save the script as `arrowkeys.ahk`.
3. Run the script by double-clicking the `arrowkeys.ahk` file.

## Script Details

The script remaps the following keys when used with the `Alt` key:

- `CapsLock` to `Alt`
- `CapsLock + j` to `Left Arrow`
- `CapsLock + l` to `Right Arrow`
- `CapsLock + i` to `Up Arrow`
- `CapsLock + k` to `Down Arrow`
- `CapsLock + u` to `Home`
- `CapsLock + o` to `End`
- `CapsLock + y` to `Page Up`
- `CapsLock + p` to `Page Down`
- `CapsLock + h` to `Ctrl + Left Arrow`
- `CapsLock + ;` to `Ctrl + Right Arrow`

## Why Remap Cursor Keys?

Remapping cursor keys can significantly enhance productivity, especially for those who spend a lot of time editing text or code. Here are some reasons why it is convenient and important:

1. **Ergonomics**: Keeping your hands on the home row (the row where your fingers naturally rest on a keyboard) reduces the need to move your hands away to reach the arrow keys. This can minimize strain and improve typing comfort.
2. **Efficiency**: By remapping frequently used navigation keys to more accessible positions, you can navigate through text and code more quickly. This reduces the time spent moving your hands and allows for faster editing.
3. **Consistency**: Using a consistent set of keybindings across different applications and environments can make it easier to switch contexts without having to adjust to different navigation methods.

## Run on Windows Startup

To run the script automatically every time Windows starts:

1. Press `Win + R`, type `shell:startup`, and press `Enter`. This will open the Startup folder.
2. Copy the `arrowkeys.ahk` script to the Startup folder.

This will ensure that the script runs every time you start your computer.
